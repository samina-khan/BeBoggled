This is an app for the game of Boggle, a fun word game.
The game itself has three modes:
- Easy
- Hard
- Online

Easy: The easy mode allows the player to progress through three warm up rounds of 3x3 grids before presenting them with 4x4 grids.
      They may play unlimited round till they chooce the end game, at which point they're shown the number of rounds they played and their total score.
Hard: This is similar to the 'easy' mode except that there are no warm up rounds and user is immediately presented with 4x4 grids from the time they start.
Online: Users can connect via bluetooth to play each other on a 4x4 grid. A winner is declared at the end of the game based on the relative number of rounds won.
